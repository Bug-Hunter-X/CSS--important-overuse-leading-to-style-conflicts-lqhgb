The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue: the use of !important to override styles, which can lead to unexpected behavior and maintenance difficulties.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

div p {
  color: red !important; 
}
```

In this scenario, even if the parent div has a color specified, the child p element's color will be forced to red due to !important.  This can make it hard to trace the source of style conflicts and can hinder maintainability and scalability of the CSS.
